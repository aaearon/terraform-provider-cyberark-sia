# Specification Quality Checklist: Principal Lookup Data Source

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality** ✅:
- Spec focuses on user workflows (Sarah, Mike, Maria, Tom, Alex) without mentioning technical implementation
- All user stories describe WHAT users need, not HOW it will be built
- Language is accessible to product managers and business stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness** ✅:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) include specific metrics (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "100% accuracy", "90% of users")
- Success criteria are fully technology-agnostic - no mention of implementation technologies
- Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 6 important boundary conditions
- Out of Scope section clearly defines what is NOT included
- Assumptions section documents 5 key assumptions

**Feature Readiness** ✅:
- Each of 10 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 5 comprehensive user stories cover all primary flows:
  - Cloud Directory users (most common)
  - Federated Directory users (enterprise)
  - Groups (access management)
  - Active Directory users (hybrid)
  - Error handling (user experience)
- All 7 success criteria are achievable and verifiable
- Spec maintains strict separation between requirements and implementation

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** - Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

The specification successfully:
- Defines clear user value proposition (eliminate manual UUID lookups)
- Provides comprehensive user scenarios with personas
- Establishes measurable success criteria
- Maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- Identifies edge cases and scope boundaries
- Documents assumptions and out-of-scope items

**Next Steps**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate technical implementation plan.
