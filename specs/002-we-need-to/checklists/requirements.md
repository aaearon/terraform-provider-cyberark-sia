- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Initial Review (2025-10-25)**:
All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

**Rationale for Success Criteria Being Technology-Agnostic**:
While some success criteria reference specific error codes (e.g., "401 Unauthorized") and technical concepts (e.g., "OAuth2 authentication"), these are justified because:

1. HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, etc.) are part of the user-facing behavior - operators see these errors in Terraform output
2. "OAuth2 authentication" describes the authentication standard being used, not the implementation
3. All criteria focus on observable outcomes (success rates, timing, error handling) rather than code structure
4. The spec avoids mentioning specific libraries, frameworks, or internal architecture

**Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ All user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- ✅ Functional requirements are comprehensive and cover authentication, resource operations, error handling, and cleanup
- ✅ Success criteria include both quantitative metrics (100% success rate, <3 seconds, 10 concurrent operations) and qualitative measures
- ✅ Edge cases identify critical scenarios (token expiration, concurrency, malformed tokens)
- ✅ Assumptions and dependencies are clearly documented
- ✅ Out of scope section prevents scope creep

**No Clarifications Needed**: The specification makes informed decisions about all implementation aspects based on:
- Existing OAuth2 implementation in certificate resource (proven pattern)
- Well-documented ARK SDK behavior (from oauth2-authentication-fix.md)
- No active users (no backward compatibility concerns)
- Standard OAuth2/JWT patterns (industry best practices)
