1. ~~Resolve CHK007 (principal_name pattern)~~ ✅ COMPLETE
2. ~~Mark CHK064 as "API-validated" in spec~~ ✅ COMPLETE
3. ~~Add CHK088 (SDK updates) to Out of Scope~~ ✅ COMPLETE
4. Optional: Add explicit UAP availability detection during provider config (CHK082) - current DNS error handling is sufficient but can be improved

**Final Recommendation**: ✅ **PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION**

**Checklist Status**: 81/107 items complete (75.7%), 23 items deferred to implementation phase (21.5%), 3 minor gaps remaining (2.8% - non-blocking).

**Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ All critical requirements documented and traceable
- ✅ API contracts, error handling, and validation requirements complete
- ✅ Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability) documented
- ✅ Edge cases and assumptions clearly stated
- ✅ Traceability matrix established (User Stories ↔ FRs ↔ Success Criteria)

**The specifications are implementation-ready.** All deferred items follow standard Terraform provider practices and will be naturally addressed during coding/testing. The 3 remaining gaps are minor enhancements that don't block implementation.
