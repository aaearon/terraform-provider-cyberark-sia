# Specification Quality Checklist: Database Policy Management - Modular Assignment Pattern

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Updated**: 2025-10-28 (Modular assignment pattern finalized)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **PASS** - Specification is written from user/business perspective without implementation details. All sections use business language (policies, access control, database assignments) rather than technical terms (resources, API calls, structs).

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **PASS** - All 28 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous:
- FR-001 through FR-013: Policy resource (metadata + conditions)
- FR-014 through FR-022: Principal assignment resource
- FR-023 through FR-028: Database assignment resource
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-016) are all measurable and technology-agnostic
- Examples: "create policy in under 1 minute", "100% idempotent operations", "composability verified"

### Edge Cases Coverage

✅ **PASS** - 18 edge cases identified covering three resource types:
- **Policy Lifecycle** (6 cases): Delete protection, concurrent updates, validation, UAP availability, import scenarios
- **Principal Assignment** (6 cases): Duplicate prevention, concurrent assignments, directory validation, orphaned references
- **Database Assignment** (3 cases): Concurrent assignments, workspace validation, orphaned references

### Scope Definition

✅ **PASS** - Scope is explicitly bounded:
- **In Scope**: THREE resources - policy (metadata+conditions), principal assignments, database assignments
- **Out of Scope**: 10 clearly defined exclusions including inline management, authoritative resources, analytics, bulk operations
- **Assumptions**: 13 documented assumptions covering UAP service, authentication, SDK version, location type, modular pattern rationale

### User Story Independence

✅ **PASS** - 6 user stories with clear priorities:
- P1: Create policies (metadata + conditions)
- P1: Assign principals to policy
- P1: Assign databases to policy
- P2: Update policy attributes
- P3: Delete policies
- P2: Import policies and assignments

Each story is independently testable and delivers standalone value.

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT - Ready for planning phase

**Key Strengths**:
1. **Modular assignment pattern**: Consistent treatment of principals and targets (both via separate assignment resources)
2. **Comprehensive resource architecture**: THREE resources with clear responsibilities (policy, principal assignment, database assignment)
3. **Team workflow support**: Security team manages policy+principals, app teams manage databases independently
4. **Pattern justification**: Explains why modular pattern chosen over inline or hybrid approaches
5. **AWS pattern alignment**: Follows `aws_security_group_rule` pattern (embedded API objects with separate assignment resources)

**Architecture Decision** (2025-10-28):
- **Pattern**: Modular assignment (both principals and targets separate)
- **Rationale**: Composability, consistency, team workflow flexibility
- **Rejected Alternatives**:
  - Inline (monolithic): Poor composability, massive blast radius
  - Hybrid (principals inline, targets separate): Inconsistent, no clear justification for different treatment

**Corrections Applied** (2025-10-28):
- Fixed Location Type assumption: SIA only supports "FQDN_IP" location type (not AWS/AZURE/GCP/ATLAS)
- All database types (regardless of cloud location) use "FQDN_IP" target set
- Added Resource Architecture section explaining modular pattern with AWS comparison
- Expanded to 3 resources: policy, principal assignment, database assignment
- Added 15 new functional requirements (FR-014 through FR-028)
- Added 8 new success criteria (SC-009 through SC-016)
- Added 3 new assumptions (#11, #12, #13)

**No Issues Found** - Specification passes all quality checks and is ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Next Steps

✅ **APPROVED** - Proceed to planning phase with `/speckit.plan`

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for technical implementation planning.
