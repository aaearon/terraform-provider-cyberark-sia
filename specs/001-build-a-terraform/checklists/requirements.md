# Specification Quality Checklist: Terraform Provider for CyberArk Secure Infrastructure Access

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec successfully avoids implementation details. Focuses on what users need (database registration, strong account management) without specifying Go, Terraform Plugin Framework, or API endpoints. Success criteria are user-focused and technology-agnostic.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Resolution Summary**:
- FR-017 removed: Strong account permission validation declared out of scope (provider assumes credentials are valid)
- FR-022 clarified: Specified ISPSS OAuth2 client credentials authentication via platformtoken endpoint
- Added FR-021, FR-022, FR-023 for detailed authentication requirements
- Added FR-001a: Specific database version requirements per SIA documentation
- Updated Assumptions section to reflect permission validation is out of scope and ISPSS service account requirement
- Updated Out of Scope section to explicitly exclude permission validation, ISPSS account management, and database creation/provisioning

**Scope Clarification (2025-10-15)**:
- User Story 1 updated to emphasize "onboarding" existing databases vs "provisioning" new ones
- All references updated to clarify: AWS/Azure providers create databases, SIA provider onboards them
- Database Target entity updated to explicitly note it represents SIA registration, not database creation
- Success criteria updated to reflect multi-provider workflow
- Edge cases updated to reflect database onboarding vs creation

**Notes**: All requirements are testable (e.g., "Users MUST be able to onboard existing databases as SIA targets" can be verified by onboarding databases of each supported type). Success criteria include specific metrics (5 minutes for complete workflow, 30 seconds for updates, 75% reduction in manual work). Edge cases comprehensively identify failure scenarios including version validation. Scope is crystal clear: databases are created elsewhere, this provider ONLY handles SIA onboarding.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- "REST API" mentioned in FR-017 is acceptable as it describes the integration interface provided by SIA itself, not our implementation choice
- ISPSS authentication details in FR-021, FR-022, FR-023 are necessary interface specifications, not implementation details
- User stories cover the complete workflow from database onboarding to SIA (P1) through strong account management (P2) to lifecycle updates/deletes (P3)
- User Story 1 correctly distinguishes between database creation (handled by AWS/Azure providers) and SIA onboarding (handled by this provider)
- Each story has clear acceptance scenarios that map to functional requirements
- Success criteria directly measure the value promised in user stories (SC-001 measures P1's "unified configuration file" promise with 5-minute end-to-end metric, SC-008 measures P2's "automated" promise with 75% time reduction)
- Database version requirements in FR-001a provide clear validation criteria

## Clarifications Resolved

All clarification questions have been answered by the user:

1. **FR-017** (Former): Strong account permission validation
   - Resolution: Declared out of scope. Provider assumes credentials have necessary permissions.
   - Rationale: Validation is external to the provider's responsibility

2. **FR-022** (Former): SIA API authentication methods
   - Resolution: Specified ISPSS OAuth2 client credentials authentication via platformtoken endpoint
   - Details: Service account with client_id/client_secret obtains bearer token for API requests
   - Reference: CyberArk ISPSS authentication documentation provided by user

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING** - Specification is complete and validated.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive research-backed content (SIA supported databases with specific version requirements, authentication methods)
- Crystal-clear scope separation: provider onboards existing databases, does NOT create them
- Clear prioritization (P1/P2/P3) with justification
- Well-defined scope boundaries with explicit out-of-scope items (database creation prominently listed)
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Thorough edge case identification including version validation scenarios
- Detailed authentication requirements based on CyberArk ISPSS documentation
- Clear assumptions about permission handling and service account setup
- User stories correctly reflect multi-provider workflow (AWS/Azure for DB creation, SIA provider for onboarding)

**Next Steps**:
Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning.
